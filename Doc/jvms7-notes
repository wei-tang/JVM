Java virtual machine operates on two kinds of types:
Primitive Types:
  +++ numeric types
   ++++ integral types
     ++++++ byte (8bits): -2^7 ~ 2^7 - 1
     ++++++ short (16bits) -2^15 ~ 2^15 - 1
     ++++++ int (32bits) -2^31 ~ 2^31 - 1
     ++++++ long (64bits) -2^63 ~ 2^63 - 1 
     ++++++ char (16bits: UTF-16) default value:'\u0000'  0 ~ 65535
    
   ++++ floating-point types 
     ++++++ float 
     ++++++ double

  +++ boolean type: boolean (default value is false)
     Java Virtual Machine does directly support boolean arrays. Its newarray 
     instruction enables creation of boolean arrays. Arrays of type boolean 
     are accessed and modified using the byte array instructions baload and bastore. 

  +++ returnAddress type
    The values of the returnAddress type are points to the opcode of Java Virtual Machine instructions.
    The returnAddress type is not directly associated with a Java programming language type.  
    The returnAddress type is used by the Java Virtual Machine's jsr,ret and jsr_w instructions.

Reference Types:
  +++ class types 
  +++ array types 
  +++ interface 

pc Register:
  Each Java Virtual Machine thread has its own pc(program counter) register.
  If the method is not native, the pc register contains the address of the Java Virtual Machine 
  instruction currently being executed. If the method is native, the value of the Java Virtual 
  Machine's pc register is undefined. 

Object: Java Virtual Machine contains explicit support for objects: class instance or array
